# binaryTree

Implementation of a binary tree with traversal algorithms in C

The binaryTree is defined as a struct that stores an int key and 2 pointers
to the left and right nodes from the current node

The following functions are implemented:

  - newNode(int data) creates a new node with the value that is passed into the function
  - preOrder(struct binaryTree) prints the preOrder traversal of the binary tree
  - inOrder(struct binaryTree) prints the inOrder traversal of the binary tree
  - postOrder(struct binaryTree) prints the postOrder traversal of the binary tree
